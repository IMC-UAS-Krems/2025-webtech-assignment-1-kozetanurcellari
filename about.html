        <h2>My Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p>
          One of my main hobbies is exploring creative work, especially web design, art, and small handmade crafts. 
          I enjoy learning new digital tools and improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, which I also practice through my university projects. 
          I love travelling and discovering new places, especially since becoming an Erasmus student—it helps me understand different cultures and meet new people. 
          In my free time, I enjoy spending peaceful moments in cafés, walking around new cities, and taking pictures. 
          I am also passionate about creating artisan items, something I dream of turning into a small business someday. 
          Creativity motivates me, and I enjoy activities where I can express myself freely. 
          I also value spending time with close friends, sharing stories, and learning from each other. 
          These hobbies and interests help me stay motivated, inspired, and balanced in my daily life.
